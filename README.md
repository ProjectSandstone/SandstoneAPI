# SandstoneAPI
Server Modding API for Minecraft.

Sandstone is very inspired by [SpongePowered](https://www.spongepowered.org/) (Some API characteristics is very similar (likely identical) to SpongePowered),
and [Bukkit API](https://bukkit.org/), but the Sandstone purpose is a bit different, Sandstone API aims to support all Minecraft Editions Platforms.

#### A Big wrapper

Some implementations is a big wrapper (and the initialization is a bit slow), but the runtime performance is acceptable (but if you are experiencing some performance problems with a official implementation, report to the implementation repository and we will try to improve the performance).
